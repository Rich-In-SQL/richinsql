Hi there, my name is Rich! I am a database developer or formerly a Senior Information Systems Analyst working in the United Kingdom. This website is my place on the internet for things I have created, articles, tutorials and anything else I would like to share, mainly related to SQL Server and data.

### Tools 

This website is hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) and powered by [Hugo](www.hugo.io)

I write this blog in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

My day job has me spending most of my time in [SQL Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) although if I have to write C# I will do that is [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

For music I use [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) but have [Castro](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241) on my iPhone for all my podcasts. 

I take notes and organise my life in [Notion](www.notion.so).

### Hardware

If you are interested in the hardware that I use, you can check out the [gear page](/gear) here.
