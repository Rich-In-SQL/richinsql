We spend much of our working life trying to help people solve SQL Server-related performance problems, either hands-on, during consulting, or on various online community forums. Over the years, we've been exposed to a few weird-and-wonderful SQL Server issues but, mainly, we've seen the same problems and the same misconceptions about how SQL Server works crop up time-and-again. This book is our attempt to describe, diagnose, and solve some of the most common problems associated with the currently-supported versions of SQL Server: SQL Server 2005, 2008, and 2008 R2.
