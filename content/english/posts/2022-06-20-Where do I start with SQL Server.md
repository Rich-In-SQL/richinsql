When I first started learning SQL Server I had no idea where to start, it is overwhelming there is so much to learn and nothing really concrete on where to start. 

For me I installed SQL Server Express on my laptop, loaded in a database and started playing with the language, coming up with scenarios as I went to learn as much as I could. 

Learning something like T-SQL can be overwhelming, so, we have put together some resources below to get you started.  

Watch Brent's [Learn how to think like the SQL Server Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fERXOywBhlA) knowing how SQL Server actually decides to process your code will pay off in the long run and is foundational.

Once you are ready to actually start writing some code [Download & Install SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16)
then install [SQL Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=101064) or [SQL Developer Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) on your computer or laptop *they are both free*, If you are unsure how to install SQL Server watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL0TADsB5kc).
 
You can then [Download a copy of the stack overflow database and attach it to the SQL Instance you just installed](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2021/03/download-the-current-stack-overflow-database-for-free-2021-02/)

Now the fun begins, Brent wrote a series of posts that [teaches you how to Query SQL Server with the StackOverflow Database](https://www.brentozar.com/learn-query-sql-server-stackoverflow-database/) buy yourself [this book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/T-SQL-Fundamentals-Itzik-Ben-Gan/dp/150930200X/ref=pd_bxgy_img_sccl_1/258-4285115-2099050?pd_rd_w=LZwbo&content-id=amzn1.sym.79b812bf-5c8b-4c0c-851c-784423adaff5&pf_rd_p=79b812bf-5c8b-4c0c-851c-784423adaff5&pf_rd_r=3P42KQNWC4ZY941WQ67P&pd_rd_wg=kTN5N&pd_rd_r=848ffd3c-240f-491a-92fe-a459de496dcd&pd_rd_i=150930200X&psc=1) and give it a read, it is good to keep on hand, it is one of them books you will find yourself going back to over and over, once you are a bit more experienced [buy this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/T-SQL-Querying-Developer-Reference-Paperback/dp/0735685045/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=T-SQL+Querying&qid=1633858162&qsid=258-5717528-6898663&s=books&sr=1-1&sres=0735685045%2C1789348811%2CB011DAKCMQ%2C0735626030%2CB015X365KC%2CB002A7QBHW%2C0735623139%2CB00NBMFE32%2CB0012L0XM6%2C8375410543%2C150930200X%2C8375411582%2CB087QS91ZD%2C0135861446%2CB00JDMQIZW%2C1484255895&srpt=ABIS_BOOK)

Code Academy also has a [course on SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/sql) that you can take or you could check out [this course on udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-sql-for-beginners/)

If you would like to get involved with the community and stay up to date with what is going on with everything SQL Server / Data you could [follow this list created by Brent on twitter](https://twitter.com/i/lists/498526) join the [SQL Server Community](https://dbatools.io/slack/) on [Slack](https://dbatools.io/slack/) or this [SQL Server Community](https://discord.gg/TvskxwGp) over on [Discord](https://discord.gg/TvskxwGp).

Happy SQLing
