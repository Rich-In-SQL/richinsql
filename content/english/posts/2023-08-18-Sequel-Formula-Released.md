It has been a long time since a blog post was written here, however today we are announcing the release of our newest SQL Server project, [Sequel Formula](https://sequel-formula.com/). 

[Sequel Formula](https://sequel-formula.com/) is a Formula One SQL Server database based on the [Ergast API](http://ergast.com/mrd) data with our own improvements to the design, the database is specifically designed for Microsoft SQL Server so a copy of that would be required to use the database, that could be express, the developer edition or if you have a full copy lying around you could use that too.

We have developed our own documentation to go along with the project which you can find [here](https://sequel-formula.com/docs/welcome) as with all of our projects, we welcome any and all suggestions for improvement which can be raised through [GitHub](https://github.com/Rich-In-SQL/Sequel-Formula).

We hope that you like playing with the Formula One data as much as we do and over the next few months we will be making some improvements to the dataset to broaden it with historical data.
