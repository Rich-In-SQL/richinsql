The [Formula One PowerBi dashboard](/formula1-powerbi-dashboard) is an un official dashboard created by RichInSQL using freely available Driver, Circuit & Constructor data.

This project makes use of the Formula One database I developed, which you can find [here](/post/2021-12-06-configuring-sqlserver-databasemail).

### Why did you make this?

I made this dashboard as a playground for PowerBi so that you can play with the imported data and create metrics that you would like to see. It also allows for you to experiment with DAX.

### Can I adapt this dashboard?

You can make changed to the dashboard as you see fit, I would much prefer you to fork the repo but you are more than welcome to adapt it for your own needs.

If you would like to contribute to my dasboard, feel free to open a pull request after you have made your changes.

### Is there any support for this dashboard? 

There is no support for the dashboard, where would the fun be in that, if you would like to make changes feel free to do so, contributing back to the project would be extremely welcome.
