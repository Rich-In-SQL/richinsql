The [Formula One PowerBi dashboard](/formula1-powerbi-dashboard) is an un official dashboard created by RichInSQL using freely available Driver, Circuit & Constructor data.

This project makes use of the Formula One database I developed, which you can find [here](/post/2021-12-06-configuring-sqlserver-databasemail).

This is an ever evolving project, I don't expect that it is perfect right now, after all this is the very first release but I am going to be using it as a place to learn various part of PowerBi and DAX and with it being publicly available, you can too.

### Why did you make this?

I made this dashboard as a playground for PowerBi, I wanted something that I could use to test new features, run experiments on and play around with the imported data. It also allows for you to experiment with DAX.

### Can I adapt this dashboard?

Of course, you can make changes to the dashboard as you see fit, fork the repository into your GitHub account and change away.

If you would like to contribute to my dashboard, maybe you see something that would be useful that I haven't included, feel free to create a pull request after you have made your changes and I will review them. 

### Is there any support for this dashboard? 

There is no support for the dashboard, where would the fun be in that?! If you would like to make changes feel free to do so, contributing back to the project would be extremely welcome.
