Another year is complete and when I was thinking about what to write for my year in review post I was thinking back to some of the things both personally and professionally that I had done that I could share. 
As with most people the past year has been up and down filled mostly with uncertainty but I don't want this post to become a COVID related rant as there I am sure there is plenty of that on the internet already. 

### I Got A New Job 

In March 2021 I applied for a new job in Informatics, the job involved mainly working from home and would require me to build datasets for the teamsâ€™ analysts, I would also be required to support with basic T-SQL queries, writing advanced T-SQL queries and building reporting solutions using SSRS, SSIS & PowerBi.

### I Explored

This year I did a lot of exploring, walking, and adventuring, being outside is good not only for my physical health but also for my mental health, working from home, being inside all day I need that escape to unwind.

### I Invested In My Blog

Towards the end of 2021 I spent a lot of effort trying to build my blog, this blog, the blog that you are reading right now, not for anyone else or to make myself popular although if what I post helps someone else that is amazing, but I am posting for myself, as a reference for what I have learnt. It is amazing how many times I go to my own blog to find answers for things I have done in the past.

### Then I Quit That Job 

It turned out that Informatics wasn't for me, well, that isn't technically true, Data & SQL Server is my passion, but I didn't fit into the team that I joined, it wasn't a good fit so at the end of 2021 I decided to leave the team and move back to the position I came from.

### I Invested In Myself

This year I spent a lot of time investing in myself, learning new things, attending conferences online and exploring new technologies. [Brent Ozar](https://www.brentozar.com/) was my main source of education, over the lockdown period he gave loads of free courses and live streams which were invaluable.

2022 has plenty of opportunity for learning new things and it is definitely something I will be doing again.

### To Recap

The year of 2021 has been up and down, lockdown, not lockdown, masks not masks, working from home then not working from home. In between all of that there was some really good experiences had, in some places that I have never been before, I attended a virtual conference for the first time and took part in some remote learning. 

### Looking Forward To 2022

I am not sure what 2022 will bring, I wasn't sure what 2021 would bring! Christmas 2020 was something like no other, I hope that Christmas 2021 is a little more normal to say the least but until it happens, we are never going to know. Whatever you end up doing in 2022 make sure you do it for yourself or your family, learn something new, visit somewhere new and experience something new.
