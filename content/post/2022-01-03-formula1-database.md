Do you have an interest in Formula One? Do you need a database for T-SQL demonstrations or testing of your T-SQL code that is open source and not the adventure works database? I might just have the answer, I have put together using freely available data a database for just that.

The un-official Formula One Database.

### What Is Included 

* Drivers 
    - 
* Constructors 
* Circuits

### Found An Issue?

If you have found an issue with the data, something isn't quite right or I have made a mistake during the import, feel free to [open an Issue](https://github.com/RichInSQL/FormulaOneDatabase/issues) on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RichInSQL/FormulaOneDatabase). 

If you would like to fix the issue yourself, I would also encourage you to create a pull request, the repo is public and a pull request would really help take this project forward. 

### Pull Requests 

If you would like to make a suggested change to the database, be that the schema or the data itself you can submit a pull request which I can then review and merge into the Main branch once tested. 

### This Sounds Cool, Where Can I Get It?

If you would like to create the database on your own instance of SQL Server you can download the installtion script from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RichInSQL/FormulaOneDatabase) and run it on your SQL Server Instance.
