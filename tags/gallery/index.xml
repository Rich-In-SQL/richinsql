      <description>I have been having a problem at work where when I try to either install or update a module on my work laptop I get the following error message.
A quick Google of the error will return a plethora of information on how to fix the issue, with the main focus being on the following two lines;
$webclient=New-Object System.Net.WebClient $webclient.Proxy.Credentials = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultNetworkCredentials For the majority of people, this seemed to resolve the issue and they could go about there business, for me however it didn’t resolve the problem, at least it wasn’t the sole fix.</description>
