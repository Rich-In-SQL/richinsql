      <description>One of the most time consuming tasks when configuring a new computer is installing all of the applications that I use on a day to day basis, I am sure that everyone has this very same problem, but recently I came accross a package manager for Windows called Chocolatey, I am sure this has been around for absoloutely ages, looking at the amount of packages that are available but for me it is still pretty new.</description>

      <description>I had an issue on one node in the new SQL 2014 cluster that had just been built S-SQL06 specifically where KB4470220 &amp;amp; KB4532095 wouldn’t install, they kept throwing an error with code 0x80070643 which when googled didn’t relate to the actual problem, I did some digging and found out what was causing the problem and thought I would share my findings in case anyone runs into this same problem in the future.</description>

      <title>Corrupting databases on purpose with dbatools</title>

      <description>So here we are going to look at corrupting a database and how we can go about restoring the individual page to that database
We don&amp;rsquo;t want to go corrupting a production database, please don&amp;rsquo;t do that, for this we will create a demonstration database called CorruptionTest
Now that we have the database created, we need to pop some data in it, so we will create a table
Once the table is created, insert a few rows</description>

      <title>Database Migration Using DbaTools</title>

      <description>This post is mainly for me to look back on in the future and see how this was done, so I will keep it short. What I needed was a way to migrate an entire instance from one availability group to another, on two new servers with an entirely new availability group name, the test instance wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been that much of a problem as there is only around 10 databases on it however the production instance houses many many more databases with various logins and agent jobs for lots of different things that would have taken a really long time to move one by one.</description>

      <description>I needed a way of getting a complete list of databases over multiple instances in SQL Server into something that I was able to manipulate, of course I could load up SSMS and run a query against the MSDB database to return me the name of every database on that instance, but that is slow, I have to connect to each instance I want to query an individually run the code;</description>

      <description>I was recently asked to move one of our production databases to a staging server, this was to allow one of our suppliers to update the schema, once the update had been complete I needed to move the database back, our production server was running SQL Server 2012 in a two node availability group, the staging server was running SQL Server 2012 Express. Here is how I made all that happen with just a few lines of PowerShell using the fantastic dbatools.</description>

      <description>I have been having a problem at work where when I try to either install or update a module on my work laptop I get the following error message.
A quick Google of the error will return a plethora of information on how to fix the issue, with the main focus being on the following two lines;
$webclient=New-Object System.Net.WebClient $webclient.Proxy.Credentials = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultNetworkCredentials For the majority of people, this seemed to resolve the issue and they could go about there business, for me however it didn’t resolve the problem, at least it wasn’t the sole fix.</description>

      <description>Last week I wrote about how I was getting started with dbatools a lot has happened since then, I mean I have done some more reading and tried a few new things and I wanted to expand on some of the really cool things this module can do.
Tables here, tables there Some times for whatever reason I need to be able to script a table out, this involves loading up SSMS, connecting to the instance, getting to the database, right clicking…you get the idea it is a long drawn out task, but what if I could do that with just one line of code?</description>

      <description>I have never really got into PowerShell it is just something that I have never needed to use, however recently I have been reading more and more about the great things that can be done with DBATools so thought I would give the module a go and see what it could do.
First thing is first I needed to find out what version of PowerShell I am using so the correct method of installation for the module could be used.</description>

      <description>So you have that really fast SSD in your development machine or that machine that is provided by your workplace, windows is installed onto it thus that is where the C: resides, the problem is that SSD is only 120GB in size, windows takes up a large chunk of that and once you install a few tools like Visual Studio, SQL Server Developer and SQL Management Studio that lovely SSD is pretty much full.</description>
