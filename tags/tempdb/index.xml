      <description>So, I have a problem, TempDB is blowing up, I don’t know what is causing it but I need to figure out why it is happening and getting so big in such a short space of time.
The Pretext Honestly, I had no where to start when it came to tracking down what might be causing TempDB to get so big, I knew that I needed something that would track changes but everything I could think of was either not very elegant or added a massive overhead to the instance.</description>
