      <description>I recently moved to a new development workstation at home, still using Windows 10 but it was a fresh install. All of the previously installed dependencies were gone, including Ruby &amp;amp; Jekyll for which this site is built.
I tried installing Ruby from the official binaries but kept running into dependency errors when trying to serve the site locally, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure it out, so I decided to see if I could get it working using the Linux Subsystem for Windows, TL;DR it worked perfectly, but wanted to share how I went about setting it up.</description>
