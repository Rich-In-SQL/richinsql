      <description>In SQL Server it is possible to insert data from one table into another using a select within the insert statement, I recently ran into an issue where a stored procedure has been written that didn’t specify the columns on the insert side of the statement and simply specified
select * from t I want to demonstrate why this might cause a problem.
Build the tables t1 which will hold all of the demo data to begin with</description>

      <description>Recently I needed to export some data from a table that was being used to hold information from a contact form, it had lots of information inside of it but for some reason the Comments column was causing lots of problems when loaded up into Excel, there would be formatting issues and text appearing on a new line when in SQL it appeared that all of that text should be on one single line.</description>

 Part One – Project Overview Part Two – Database Schema Part Three – Stored Procedures  Stored Procedures are going to power the flow of data in and out of the Formula One Race Tracker, I will make use of a stored procedure for sending my data into the application and I am also going to make use of a stored procedure for getting the data back out again.</description>

      <description>Recently I was asked to look into the possibility of encrypting some of the column level data that is held within a SQL Server instance, not knowing where to start and not running SQL Server 2017 I set about looking for options, one of which was to use Symmetric Keys &amp;amp; Certificates to encrypt the data and in this post I am going to demonstrate how I did that and what I learned.</description>

 Part One – Project Overview Part Two – Database Schema  The Database Schema In Part One we looked at the project scope, why I was building this project, how the database was going to look, the columns and their respective datatypes and a mock-up of the application design, in this part I am going to show you how I went about populating the database with the objects required and then filling them objects with referential data.</description>

 Part One – Project Overview Part Two – Database Schema  A little while ago I answered a question over on StackOverflow from someone who was asking how they could design a database that would allow them to track individual races in a Formula One season, this question formed the foundation for this series of posts which will hopefully demonstrate my building process of a small simplistic web application, using a lot of what I have learned over the last five years.</description>

      <title>SQL Server And Dates</title>

      <description>Dates are one of the things I find myself googling more than anything else when writing queries, so I thought I would write a post with a few examples on how to get different combinations of date for use in your queries.
Let’s say we have a date and we want to get just the month, or the week or even just the year, how can we do that?
SELECT DATEPART(month,GETDATE()) AS [Month], DATEPART(wk,GETDATE()) AS [Week], DATEPART(year,GETDATE()) AS [Year] You see, the Month, Week &amp;amp; Year have been split from the DATETIME column and returned as their seperate values.</description>
