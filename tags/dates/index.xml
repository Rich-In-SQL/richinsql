      <description>Dates are one of the things I find myself googling more than anything else when writing queries, so I thought I would write a post with a few examples on how to get different combinations of date for use in your queries.
Letâ€™s say we have a date and we want to get just the month, or the week or even just the year, how can we do that?
SELECT DATEPART(month,GETDATE()) AS [Month], DATEPART(wk,GETDATE()) AS [Week], DATEPART(year,GETDATE()) AS [Year] You see, the Month, Week &amp;amp; Year have been split from the DATETIME column and returned as their seperate values.</description>
