      <description>Recently I was writing a login process that required me to query Active Directory, admittedly something I have never done before, I took to the internet to search for a solution on how this was going to work and came across the following query string to use within my existing class.
search.Filter = &amp;#34;(&amp;amp;(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(anr=&amp;#34; + Username + &amp;#34;)(!userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2))&amp;#34;; I set to test this with multiple users, and it worked perfectly, the correct data was returned in 100% of the test cases that I had tried, so the code got moved into production and signed off.</description>
