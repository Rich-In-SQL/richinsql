 Part One – Project Overview Part Two – Database Schema  The Database Schema In Part One we looked at the project scope, why I was building this project, how the database was going to look, the columns and their respective datatypes and a mock-up of the application design, in this part I am going to show you how I went about populating the database with the objects required and then filling them objects with referential data.</description>

 Part One – Project Overview Part Two – Database Schema  A little while ago I answered a question over on StackOverflow from someone who was asking how they could design a database that would allow them to track individual races in a Formula One season, this question formed the foundation for this series of posts which will hopefully demonstrate my building process of a small simplistic web application, using a lot of what I have learned over the last five years.</description>

      <title>How I Configure SQL Management Studio</title>

      <description>When you first install SQL Management Studio (SSMS) there are lots of options shown in the toolbar, half of these you will never use and if you know the key bindings for some of the common ones like copy &amp;amp; paste it is faster to use the keyboard than reach for the mouse and click it.
As of 23/12/2018 this is how I have my installation of SSMS 17.9.1 configured, some of the tools I use are third party, they are linked where applicable.</description>

      <description>So you have that really fast SSD in your development machine or that machine that is provided by your workplace, windows is installed onto it thus that is where the C: resides, the problem is that SSD is only 120GB in size, windows takes up a large chunk of that and once you install a few tools like Visual Studio, SQL Server Developer and SQL Management Studio that lovely SSD is pretty much full.</description>
