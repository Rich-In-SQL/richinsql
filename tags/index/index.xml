      <description>Recently I ran into an issue I had never experienced before, a third party vendor was using Full-Text Indexing on one of the databases in their application, as part of their nightly routine they would do an incremental rebuild of the full-text index and then once a week a full rebuild of that index would take place, this wasnâ€™t causing any SQL related problems but I found one day that the C:\ on that instance had become rather full and had triggered the disk alarm on our monitoring application.</description>
