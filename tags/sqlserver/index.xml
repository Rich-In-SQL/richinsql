      <description>I was recently asked to move one of our production databases to a staging server, this was to allow one of our suppliers to update the schema, once the update had been complete I needed to move the database back, our production server was running SQL Server 2012 in a two node availability group, the staging server was running SQL Server 2012 Express. Here is how I made all that happen with just a few lines of PowerShell using the fantastic dbatools.</description>

      <description>In SQL Server it is possible to insert data from one table into another using a select within the insert statement, I recently ran into an issue where a stored procedure has been written that didn’t specify the columns on the insert side of the statement and simply specified
select * from t I want to demonstrate why this might cause a problem.
Build the tables t1 which will hold all of the demo data to begin with</description>

      <description>Recently I needed to export some data from a table that was being used to hold information from a contact form, it had lots of information inside of it but for some reason the Comments column was causing lots of problems when loaded up into Excel, there would be formatting issues and text appearing on a new line when in SQL it appeared that all of that text should be on one single line.</description>

 Part One – Project Overview Part Two – Database Schema Part Three – Stored Procedures  Stored Procedures are going to power the flow of data in and out of the Formula One Race Tracker, I will make use of a stored procedure for sending my data into the application and I am also going to make use of a stored procedure for getting the data back out again.</description>

      <description>Recently I was asked to look into the possibility of encrypting some of the column level data that is held within a SQL Server instance, not knowing where to start and not running SQL Server 2017 I set about looking for options, one of which was to use Symmetric Keys &amp;amp; Certificates to encrypt the data and in this post I am going to demonstrate how I did that and what I learned.</description>

 Part One – Project Overview Part Two – Database Schema  The Database Schema In Part One we looked at the project scope, why I was building this project, how the database was going to look, the columns and their respective datatypes and a mock-up of the application design, in this part I am going to show you how I went about populating the database with the objects required and then filling them objects with referential data.</description>

      <description>This month’s T-SQL Tuesday comes from Todd Kleinhans (Blog &amp;amp; Twitter) he asked, “what do YOU use databases for in your personal life?”
 I’m curious- outside of work and learning, what do you personally use databases for? Tracking books you have, recipes, collections, etc? While it can be said using databases for personal use could be either overkill or a hammer in search of nails on the other hand, it is exactly what they are for- storing data.</description>

 Part One – Project Overview Part Two – Database Schema  A little while ago I answered a question over on StackOverflow from someone who was asking how they could design a database that would allow them to track individual races in a Formula One season, this question formed the foundation for this series of posts which will hopefully demonstrate my building process of a small simplistic web application, using a lot of what I have learned over the last five years.</description>

      <title>Taking dbatools further</title>

      <description>Last week I wrote about how I was getting started with dbatools a lot has happened since then, I mean I have done some more reading and tried a few new things and I wanted to expand on some of the really cool things this module can do.
Tables here, tables there Some times for whatever reason I need to be able to script a table out, this involves loading up SSMS, connecting to the instance, getting to the database, right clicking…you get the idea it is a long drawn out task, but what if I could do that with just one line of code?</description>

      <description>Recently I came across a stored procedure I had written a few years ago, when I first started as a developer I was given a task where I needed to write a stored procedure that allowed users to update an underlying table but also track the changes, what data had been amended and who amended it, to make it work I made use of an audit table to capture them details around which users were doing what.</description>

      <title>Whats eating up tempdb</title>
      <link>https://richinsql.com/posts/2019-02-20-big-tempdb/</link>

      <guid>https://richinsql.com/posts/2019-02-20-big-tempdb/</guid>
      <description>So, I have a problem, TempDB is blowing up, I don’t know what is causing it but I need to figure out why it is happening and getting so big in such a short space of time.
The Pretext Honestly, I had no where to start when it came to tracking down what might be causing TempDB to get so big, I knew that I needed something that would track changes but everything I could think of was either not very elegant or added a massive overhead to the instance.</description>

      <title>How I Configure SQL Management Studio</title>
      <link>https://richinsql.com/posts/2018-12-23-ssms-config-2018/</link>

      <guid>https://richinsql.com/posts/2018-12-23-ssms-config-2018/</guid>
      <description>When you first install SQL Management Studio (SSMS) there are lots of options shown in the toolbar, half of these you will never use and if you know the key bindings for some of the common ones like copy &amp;amp; paste it is faster to use the keyboard than reach for the mouse and click it.
As of 23/12/2018 this is how I have my installation of SSMS 17.9.1 configured, some of the tools I use are third party, they are linked where applicable.</description>

      <title>SQL Server And Dates</title>
      <link>https://richinsql.com/posts/2018-11-05-dates/</link>

      <guid>https://richinsql.com/posts/2018-11-05-dates/</guid>
      <description>Dates are one of the things I find myself googling more than anything else when writing queries, so I thought I would write a post with a few examples on how to get different combinations of date for use in your queries.
Let’s say we have a date and we want to get just the month, or the week or even just the year, how can we do that?
SELECT DATEPART(month,GETDATE()) AS [Month], DATEPART(wk,GETDATE()) AS [Week], DATEPART(year,GETDATE()) AS [Year] You see, the Month, Week &amp;amp; Year have been split from the DATETIME column and returned as their seperate values.</description>

      <description>Recently I ran into an issue I had never experienced before, a third party vendor was using Full-Text Indexing on one of the databases in their application, as part of their nightly routine they would do an incremental rebuild of the full-text index and then once a week a full rebuild of that index would take place, this wasn’t causing any SQL related problems but I found one day that the C:\ on that instance had become rather full and had triggered the disk alarm on our monitoring application.</description>
